					<p>Information systems are responsible for collecting, storing, processing and providing knowledge
						about information from a range of sources. Information systems are an integrated set of
						components that bring together hardware, software, networking, database storage as well as the
						human process that may be involved.</p>
					<p>These systems are integral to the products and services that we rely on as a society and as such
						it is imperative that they are well-designed and developed. Object oriented design and
						development provides a structured approach to creating sustainable and manageable solutions.</p>
					<p>The module examines the different elements of an information system from design through to
						processing and storage. You will explore the fundamental concepts behind object-oriented
						development using UML as a tool for analysis and design. Further to this, we will make use of
						Python to provide concrete experience of object-oriented development.</p>

					<h2>Information System Failure case study - Equifax data breach</h2>
					<p>Equifax, which is one of the credit reporting agencies that assess the financial health of the
						Americans, has breached personally identifying data of hundreds of millions people in March
						2017. Lax security and corruption were the critics of Equifax being accused of in the aftermath.
					</p>
					<p><b>Brief reasons for the failure</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Due to failures in Equifax's internal processes, a widely known vulnerability in a consumer
							complaint web portal was used by the hackers. The vulnerability should have been patched but
							was
							not because of the failures in Equifax's internal processes.</li>
						<li>The information systems were not adequately segmented from one another, thus the attackers
							were able to move from the web portal to other servers.</li>
						<li>Since an encryption certificate on one of their internal security tools was failed to
							renew, data was pulled out of the network in encrypted form which is undetected for months.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p><b>Impact of the failure</b>
					<ul>
						<li>143 million people was potentially affected</li>
						<li>Personal information (names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, drivers'
							licenses numbers) of more than 40% of the population of the United States was exposed</li>
						<li>The upper ranks of Equifax's C-suite rapidly turned over</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p><b>Recommendations from Mandiant’s report (2017)</b>
					<ul>
						<li>reduce the scope of sensitive data retained in backend database</li>
						<li>increase restrictions and controls for accessing data housed within critical databases</li>
						<li>deploy additional web application firewalls and tuning signatures to block attacks</li>
						<li>accelerate the deployment of file integrity monitoring technologies on application and web
							servers</li>
						<li>accelerate deployment of a privileged account management solution</li>
						<li>enhance visibility for encrypted traffic by deploying additional inline network traffic
							decryption capabilities</li>
						<li>deploy additional endpoint detection and response agent technologies</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p><b>Human factor of the failure</b><br>
						Not only the system or server structural vulnerability make it convenient for the attacker,
						factors of management or mechanism actually involved a lot in the information system failure.
						The unpatched server vulnerabilities since the administrator missed the email from the CISO, the
						lack of formal process in place for vulnerability patching and the lack of authorities with
						mechanisms to auto-renew the digital certificates.

					<h2>Information System Failure Summary</h2>
					<!-- <p><b>Magna etiam veroeros</b> -->
					<p>While successful delivery of an Information System lays an important foundation for the future
						development of a company, resources and managerial effort in the continuous maintenance and
						updates of the system is also indispensable but easily being insufficient and overlooked. In the
						case of 2017 Equifax data breach, in addition to the system’s server structural vulnerability,
						which is the unsegmented server, problems in terms of management actually involved a lot
						(Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 2018). The email missed by the administrator
						concerning server vulnerabilities patching, lack of formal process for vulnerability patching
						and lack of authorities with mechanisms for renewing the digital certificates.
					</p>
					<p>Importance of rigorous policies for Information System regular updating and related staff
						training could also be seen in the cases provided by my fellow peers. For example, the
						outsourcing caused lost knowledge for regular system updates of the Royal Bank of Scotland
						system (Worstall, 2012) and the outdated hardware component, computer operation system and
						unimplemented security path of National Health Service (Hoeksma, 2017).
					</p>
					<p>The updating and vulnerability patching of systems may be problematic and consuming for many
						institutions, especially when the installation of a patch requires a server or device to be
						restarted which may cause a service outage (Secure Team, 2019). Besides, the possible
						operational changes may be introduced and training may be required which may cause the companies
						less motivated to practice regular update and patching.
					</p>
					<p>
						When it comes to loss of possible system incidents, expenditure on system updates and staff
						training would be worthy. Therefore, resources should not be spared for rigorous mechanism and
						policy for regular update and maintenance of the Information System, as well as staff training.
					</p>
					<p>
						Change management team could be one of the policies, which aims at avoiding potential stability
						issues that arise from the patch and reduces the inconvenience caused by the update to all the
						stakeholders(Caiazzo, 2020). Efficient patch management suggested by Secure Team (2019) through
						network segmentation and automation may also reduce the cost of updating. Secure Team (2019)
						also suggested regimes like PCI-DSS for better identification of system vulnerabilities and how
						they could be fixed by the patches.

					</p>

					<p><b>Network Segmentation</b><br>
						<br>Network Segmentation divides a network into multiple smaller networks, which is called a
						subnet
						(Andress J. & Leary M., 2017). Common set of security policies are applied by a group of assets
						of a subnet (Dosal, 2019).
					</p>
					<p>The possible configuration of segmentation may include according to the departments of a company.
						For instance, the network of R&D department would be restricted considering the commercial
						secret, while the accounting department has internal access with all the branches. For the other
						components of the information system, there would be various server networks and a security
						network which protects management devices such as IDS consoles, syslog servers and backup
						servers. Besides, some systems should be segmented off (Metivier, 2017), like the physical
						security system and the industrial control system.</p>
					<p>In terms of the security advantages of network segmentation, smaller subnets could reduce the
						blast radius of a possible intrusion. In the case of Equifax, if the guest network and server
						network were segmented, data of customers would not be breached. Flow of traffic between subnets
						can also be controlled such as prevention of unauthorized network traffic. </p>
					<p>Regarding the benefits on the vulnerability patching of the information system, better scheduling
						for the patches on different subnets and servers of the information system could be achieved
						with less possible effect on the operation. Segmented networks with its related servers could be
						identified with their relative value and levels of risks (Secure Team, 2017). For instance,
						networks or servers with lower value and risks, such as development systems and test systems,
						could be configured to be updated automatically considering its limited possible side-effect.
						Networks or servers with higher value and risk, such as customer facing systems, may need to
						apply patches manually in order to reduce opportunities of service outage. </p>

					<h2>Unified Modelling Language</h2>
					<p>UML (Unified Modelling Language) is an industry-standard graphic notation for specifying,
						visualizing, constructing and documenting the artefacts of software systems, which was invented
						by Ivar Jacobson, Grady Booch and Jim Rumbaugh. UML uses diagrams to express the object-oriented
						analysis and design of software systems, and we are going to discuss how to exploit UML to
						formally collect and document our systems. (Fowler M., 2003)<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p>Class diagrams are one of the most commonly used UML diagrams and are used to describe the
						objects that make up a system and the relationships between them. They are essentially a way of
						designing and documenting an object-oriented system.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p><b>UML Class Diagram exercise - online store</b></p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Class Diagram_Justin.PNG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						For the rationale of the class diagram design, it was first derived from the user account and
						the
						administrator of the online-store accounts, which are OnlineStoreAccount and
						WebsiteAdministrator. OnlineStoreAccount includes the accounts of the customers and third-party
						sellers, which is also inherited as an individual seller or seller of organization.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p>In terms of the WebsiteAdminstrator, there are two types of administrators: administrators
						managing the product selling of the website's own company and the administrators maintaining and
						developing the functionality of the online store, such as managing the website user account,
						product genre and the searching system.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p>Besides, there is a Catalogue of each seller, including the third-party organization or
						individual seller and the administrate website seller.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p>As for the customer, there is a ShoppingBasket of each account and unlimited zero to unlimited
						number of orders, promotional codes and gift vouchers.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p>Concerning the Order Class, each order is composed of at least one Product and one DeliveryMethod
						selected. Order or orders are being taken care of by the WarehouseStaff using the Stock
						Database.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p>Regarding the Product, each product belongs to a Catalogue of a seller and a Genre, while it also
						represents at least one product of an Order and a BasketItem of the Shopping Basket. Each
						Product also owns at least one keyword and only one ProductPage.<br>&nbsp</p>

					<h2>SQL Normalization</h2>
					<p>Normal forms of normalization:
					<ul>
						<li>First Normal Form (1NF): this form is achieved if every value is atomic and each row is
							unique</li>
						<li>Second Normal Form (2NF): this form is achieved if it is already in first normal and every
							column that isn't part of the primary key is dependent on the primary key itself</li>
						<li>Third Normal Form (3NF): this form is achieved if table is in second normal form and every
							column that is not part of the primary key is only dependent on the primary key itself</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p><b>Normalization exercise - online store EER diagram</b></p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/EER_digram_online_store.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>Originally, the table of sellers includes the details of the organization including its id, name,
						email and description for. However, after considering the Second Normal Form (2NF), a table of
						‘organizations’ was separated from the ‘sellers’ table. The id of the organization is stored in
						the ‘seller’ table instead of the information.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p>Also, considering the Third Normal Form (3NF), the table of ‘sellers’ and ‘customer’ were
						separated from the table ‘account’. Both seller and customer have their related information,
						including ‘third_party’ and ‘org_id’ for seller and ‘address’ for the customer. Therefore if the
						information of seller and customer is included in the ‘account’ table, rules of ‘every column
						that is not part of the primary key is only dependent on the primary key itself’ would be
						violated.</p>

					<h2>SQL & NoSQL database</h2>
					<p><b>Brief comparison - SQL vs NoSQL</b><br>
						<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="../images/SQLvsNoSQL.PNG" alt="" /></span> -->
						SQL is relational database, while NoSQL is non-rational or distributed database. Relational SQL
						databases are indisputable for their consistency and reliability. However, when it comes to
						flexibility and high operational speed, SQL relational databases may fall short due to their
						rigid schema. NoSQL databases are better with speed, scalability, range of data models and
						global availability because of their flexible schema and support for unstructured data. For
						instance, NoSQL databases were utilized by Amazon, Google and Yahoo instead of relational
						databases which may bring the system down due to massive processing of ‘join’ operations and
						read and write. Moreover, NoSQL databases have been playing a great part in the development of
						big data, which requires fast or real-time analysis of huge amounts of unstructured data.<br>&nbsp
					</p>

						comparison with
						relational databases. International Journal of Applied Information Systems, 5(4), 16-19.</p> -->

					<p><b>Main types of NoSQL database</b><br>&nbsp</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/types_of_NoSQL.PNG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>According to Amrit Bhatia (2020), NoSQL databases originally refer to “Non-SQL” or
						“Non-Relational” databases model data which are in non-tabular relations with more flexible data
						models. NoSQL databases are useful for managing unstructured data and storing the record in a
						schema-less fashion. As Bhatia mentioned (2020), there are mainly four categories of NoSQL
						systems: Document, KeyValue, Wide-column and Graph Databases.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Document Databases: <br>
							These databases do not need to have a schema, therefore they are quite flexible and easy to
							modify. Document databases are suitable for applications which need to store varying
							attributes with large amounts of data.
							<ul>
								<li>Examples of application: data of CMS systems, e-commerce, blogging, platforms,
									real-time analytics</li>
								<li>Examples of databases: MongoDB and CouchDB</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Key-Value Databases: <br>
							These databases have simple types since it stores data as a hashtable or dictionary in which
							the keys are the dictionary work while the value is the definition of that word. Simple way
							is used instead of query language, such as string, JSON or BLOB (Binary Large Objects).
							Key-value databases are good for storing large amounts of data without a need of performing
							complex retrieving queries. Therefore, they offer fast performance for reads and writes
							since they are just performing searching single key and returning its value instead of
							performing complex aggregations.
							<ul>
								<li>Examples of application: user session in web applications and real-time
									recommendation</li>
								<li>Examples of databases: Redis and DynanoDB</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Wide-Column Databases: <br>
							These databases are column-based. They are similar to a relational database storing data in
							tabular form with rows and columns but with a lot of flexibility. Each row is not required
							to have the same columns. Wide-columne databases are suitable to store large amounts of data
							with query patterns to be used.
							<ul>
								<li>Examples of application: warehouses data, business intelligence and CRM</li>
								<li>Examples of databases: Cassandra and HBase</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Graph Databases:<br>
							These databases store data in nodes and edges. Nodes store information about entities, while
							edges define relationships. Each node and edge has a unique identifier. These
							multi-relational databases are suitable for situations where various data connections need
							to be visualized and analysed for different patterns.
							<ul>
								<li>Examples of application: social networks, fraud detection, logistics network
									analysis, spatial data and recommendation engines</li>
								<li>Examples of graph: InfiniteGraph, JanusGraph and Neo4j</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Object Oriented Databases:<br>
							These databases store data or information which is represented as objects. They are like a
							combination of object oriented programming and the principle of database such as data
							encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. Accessing data is fast in case the
							object-oriented objects can be directly retrieved using pointers(Nayak, 2013), which makes
							modern software development easier to be agile.

					<p><b>Non-SQL or Not-Only-SQL? </b><br>
						In view of the development trend of the usage of database, the meaning of NoSQL is more suitably
						about Not-only SQL instead of Non-SQLwhich is originally referred to. As Puthenveettil (2017)
						mentioned, only the normal SQL relational database with tabular data modelling can accomplish
						ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability), JOIN with normalization and filter columns
						in the table. On the other hand, only non-relational databases can be applied for unstructured
						data or information analysis in big data. NoSQL databases, which filter only rows in the big
						data, can achieve many implementations in data modelling. Categorizing the databases becomes
						more difficult and unnecessary, as Puthenveettil (2017) also stated that it should be more about
						the modelling. NewSQL and neo4j may be the examples, which are non-relational databases with
						ACID.

					<h2>Object Oriented Information System</h2>
					<p><b>Inheritance</b><br>
						Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from
						another class. In the exercise of online store development, inheritance is implemented for the
						classes including account, customer, third-party seller and website seller. Since the user of
						the online store is either customer or seller, class ‘Account’ is inherited to the class
						‘Customer’ and ‘Seller’.</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Class_Account.png" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Class_Customer.png" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Class_Seller.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>As there are third-party sellers, including individual sellers or organizational sellers, and
						website sellers, Class ‘Seller’ is then inherited as classes including
						‘ThirdPartyIndividualSeller’, ‘ThirdPartyAdminOrgSeller’ and ‘WebsiteSeller’. The child class of
						'Seller' have additional attributes such as 'organization_id' and attributes with default value,
						which is used for identify seller is third-party or not</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Class_ThirdPartySeller.png" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/Class_WebsiteSeller.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p><b>Functions</b><br>
						Functions of the classes defined are mainly associated with the operation with the database
						using MySQL. First, all classes of account, customer and seller have functions:<br>
						1. Functions of adding a new object instance with information stored to the database</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/addCustomer.png" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/addSeller.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>2. Functions of getting information from the database and init an instance</p>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/getCustomerInfo.png" alt="" /></span>
					<span class="image main"><img src="../images/getSellerInfo.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>There are also functions of class ‘Customer’ and ‘Seller’ related to products respectively. <br>
						1. Customer class: productToBasket(poduct_id, quantity), checkBasket(),
						purchaseBasketToOrder()<br>
						2. Seller class: addProduct(productName, price, genre, description, quantity), listProducts()
					</p>
					<p>In addition, ‘Order’ class is used for recording each order and is defined with functions for the
						processes of purchasing and choosing delivery methods.<br>&nbsp</p>
					<p><b>Reflection on achieving proposed features</b><br>
						Reflection according to the class diagram proposed before.
						Comparison will be carried out between the proposed features and the conduct features.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Features achieved: <br>
							<ul>
								<li>Classes with functions for the customers and different types of sellers of the
									online store.
									Basic functions of the transaction operations defined including basket operations,
									purchasing order with functions for choosing payment and delivery methods and adding
									products.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Features discarded: <br>
							<ul>
								<li>The ‘BasketItems’ and ‘ShoppingBasket’ classes proposed were discarded.
									‘BasketItems’ class was discarded considering that the basket items’ related
									operations are already defined in functions of the customer. For the
									‘ShoppingBasket’ class proposed, it was not defined due to the similar reason for
									the ‘BasketItems’ class. It seems redundant to initiate another instance of basket
									for each customer. <br>
									The ‘Catalogue’ class was discarded as well, since most operations of managing
									products for the sellers were defined with functions in the class ‘Seller’ and the
									seller of each product is already recorded with ‘seller_id’ in the table of
									‘products’.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Features unattempted: <br>
							<ul>
								<li>Purchase operations such as using gift voucher or promotional codes when purchase,
									the searching systems, warehouse operations and the classes such as
									‘WebsiteMaintenanceAdmin’.</li>

					<h2>Emerging trends in information system</h2>
					<p>Information systems are combinations of hardware, software, and telecommunications networks that
						people build and use to collect, create, and distribute useful data, typically in organizational
						settings. (Valacich, 2013) The ‘information’ is defined as the data organized in a way that is
						useful. There are five megatrends of information technology since 2013 according to Valacich
						(2013), which are mobile, social media, big data, cloud computing and consumerization of
						IT.<br>&nbsp</p>

					<p>In addition to the megatrends which can be observed with the impact of information technology
						development, information technologies are increasing the part they play in most industries
						globally or even fostering the emergence of new industries.<br>&nbsp</p>

					<p><b>Drones</b><br>
						One of the emerging information technologies is the drones. According to EGHAM (2019), the
						worldwide shipments of Internet of Things (IoT) enterprise flying drones in 2020 are 526,000
						units, which is 50% more than that of 2019, and it is forecasted to reach 1.3 million units by
						2023.<br>&nbsp<br>

						The drones are early adopted and increasingly being used by the construction sector.
						Construction tasks such as site surveying and earthworks management carried by drones instead of
						workers are faster and safer. In addition to the construction sector, which has the highest use
						cases of drones globally, fire services monitoring, insurance investigation, police evidence
						gathering and retail fulfillment are the other most global usages with IoT drones adopted
						(Gartner, 2019).<br>&nbsp<br>

						The development of information systems, such as the Geospatial information system (GIS), related
						to the increasing drone usage in different sectors globally is of paramount importance. It would
						be demanding for the IS in order to fully utilize the massive information collected by drones
						and considering that the remote capabilities of drones coupled with AI applications are
						increasingly required as well (Watters, 2020). Besides, as Brooks (2019) stated, data overload
						may also be the possible problem for the IS. Drones are great at collecting a wealth of data,
						but organizing and parsing the data into useful data and transmitting it wirelessly to the
						destination is still challenging.<br>&nbsp<br>
