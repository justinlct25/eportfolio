                    <h2>Unit 1 - Introduction to Secure Software Development</h2>
                    <p>This week, the lecturecast has brought me through the brief information and basics in the problems in cybercrime, weakness and proactive controls advised by the OWASP, integration of security measures in Agile model and the usage of
                        UML diagrams. In the discussion forum, I read some in-depth investigations on the most possible software weaknesses identified by OWASP written from my classmates. </p>
                    <p>With little experience in programming after participating in a boot camp since February, I started working in an IOT company this month. During this short period of time doing practical programming, the developing environments I am
                        in are totally functional driven with less security concerns involved. In boot camp, it is all about how I can make some fancy-looking stuff within a short period of time or a agile development model without security concerns.
                        In my new company, most of the IOT data collecting and processing are not private or personal data and thus less priority in security. This unit has broadened my horizon especially in terms of the software security and the possible
                        weaknesses. </p>

                    <h2>Unit 2 - UML Modelling to Support Secure System Planning</h2>
                    <p>I continue reading the book “Software Architecture with Python” in chapters 1 and 6. In the Chapter 1 Principles of Software Architecture, I got a glimpse of the importance of early stage design of software architecture, knowing that
                        the architectural quality can be observed by various attributes like modifiability, testability, scalability, performance and the one which is also the protagonist of this module, security. In Chapter 6 Writing Secure Code, I got
                        familiar with some security concerns in writing Python such as: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reading input: use raw input over the input in order to return input as plain text instead of evaluating Python expression. Besides, getpass is a good library to perform validations on the returned data</li>
                        <li>Evaluating expression: avoid using eval and exec</li>
                        <li>Serialization: avoid using pickle / cPickle</li>
                        <li>Overflow error: Python does not suffer from pure buffer overflow errors, but for overridden __len__ methods on classes, guard should be implemented against integer overflows by using exception or TypeError handler</li>
                        <li>String formatting: prefer newer and safer format of template strings over older %s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also in this Secure Code chapter, I found it interesting in studying race conditions. Python provides an excellent set of threading primitives. Race conditions and deadlocks are avoided by the threading primitives set to synchronize
                        access to resources, such as threading.Lock. I had less concept in the topics related to condition, since at the moment most of my practical programming experience was in boot camp in which I was using Node.js in Typescript. But
                        then I also found that although Node.js is a single threaded application, it is still possible to run into race conditions. The reason is that the program workflow includes I/O (database, file system) running on many threads. It
                        is possible that the shared resource is outside of the Node.js being accessed or operated at the same time.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Unit 3 - Programming Language: History, Concepts & Design</h2>
                    <p>I again learned a lot from the lecturecast this week. I have learned about the difference between the compiled language (eg. C, C++, Objective-C) and interpreted/scripting language (eg. JavaScript and PhP). The former is expressed
                        in the instructions of the target machine in machine code, while the latter one is read and executed by some other program instead of directly executed by the target machine. There are also some hybrid languages like Java. I also
                        learned about types of programming paradigms (imperative & declarative) and types of data (static & dynamic). </p>
                    <p>Besides, I also went into discussion with my teammates on the topic of “What is a Secure Programming Language”. I have changed my mindset about the effect of selecting a programming language on the security aspect of the software.
                        More details were recorded in the following. </p>

                    <h2>Unit 4 - Exploring Programming Concepts</h2>
                    <p>I continue reading the book “Software Architecture with Python”. I enjoyed reading the Chapter 7 Design Patterns in Python. I felt the power of structural design pattern with the intricacies of combining classes or objects into larger
                        meaningful structures, providing the architect and developer with reusable behaviors. I have experimented with some patterns in Visual Studio Code. I went through the basic Singleton pattern first, which ensures just a single actual
                        instance at a specific memory location which is accessible via a well-known access point. Along the process, I drilled into understanding the reasons of some usage of the dunder methods (eg. using __new__ to intercept and modify
                        the arguments before the immutable object is created & using __call__ in Singleton metaclass which invoked when an instance of a class is used as a callable. ) and the reason of the meta-class version of Singleton inheriting from
                        “type”, knowing that type is in fact a built-in metaclass used by Python to create all classes behind the scenes. I also tried other patterns, including builder pattern, factory pattern and prototype pattern as well. I will investigate
                        more usage of different patterns in the future. </p>
                    <p>I also did some investigation into regex for the porfolio component. More details were recorded in the following. </p>

                    <h2>Unit 5 - An Introduction to Testing</h2>
                    <p>This week I was mainly focusing on studying the testing of software. I read Chapter 3 of the book “Software Architecture with Python”. Since the start of my programming journey from February, I have not done any test cases for all
                        the projects I participated in bootcamp and the current project at work. Thus, I did not have clear concepts on the implementation of test cases, its advantages and even think it may not be necessary and time consuming to write.
                    </p>
                    <p>By reading this chapter, I start understanding the importance of testing, especially in terms of maintainability and security. Testability of a software system is a good indicator of quality, complexity, stability and predictability
                        of a software system. I found that it is also a good mindset to think about how to make the code easily being tested while implementing the functionalities. In pursuing to write comprehensive unit tests also reduces the final coupling
                        level of the codes.</p>
                    <p>I also do some reading and discussion with teammates about the Cyclomatic Complexity. More details were recorded in the following. </p>

                    <h2>Unit 6 - Using Linters to Support Python Testing</h2>
                    <p>Some linter libraries were attempted. The function of linters in supporting quality Python code development was experienced. </p>
                    <p>Most of the time was spent on finishing the design document of the team project. We have defined the usage of the application which is Threat Manager or reporting platform. The common vulnerabilities identified by OWASP have served
                        as the structure in proposing all the security measures. I think this is a really good way to plan security measures, having reduced probability of missing common risks. </p>
                    <p>I was trying to make a class diagram of the system, but eventually found it quite time consuming, especially in defining class functions. Instead, a normalized SQL structure diagram was sketched. </p>

                    <h2>Unit 7 - Introduction to Operating System</h2>
                    <p>I increased my understanding in operating systems through the lecturecast of this week. I learned the main functions of an OS, including providing numbers of interfaces (eg.GUI, CLI, API and Device Drivers), resource management (eg.memory,
                        file system, CPU), Abstraction and virtualization etc. </p>
                    <p>I also tried to write my own interactive shell in Python referencing the blogs provided in reading. I have identified some vulnerabilities and also tried to implement some measures on it. More details were recorded in the following.</p>

                    <h2>Unit 8 - Cryptography and Its Use in Operating System</h2>
                    <p>This week, I participated in a discussion about the Cryptography case study: TrueCrypt. During the process, I have found the importance of auditing especially for software related to security. I also get acquainted with what attributes
                        and ways auditors used to determine whether a software is secure. From reading the post from the classmates, I also found how much improvement was achieved by the cryptography industry these years. </p>
                    <p>In addition to the discussion, I also attempted to use one of the encryption algorithms in generating an encrypted version of a plain text and decrypted it. More details were recorded in the following. </p>

                    <h2>Unit 9 - Developing an API for a Distributed Environment</h2>
                    <p>More time was contributed to building the functionalities of the Threat Manager application projects this week. In addition to that, I also copied the code this week to run an API server for a distributed environment. More details
                        were recorded in the following. </p>

                    <hr class="major" />
                    <h2>Unit 10 - From Distributed Computing to Microarchitectures</h2>
                    <p>From the lecturecast this week, I realized the advantages of a distributed system in microarchitectures. Compared to the monolithic architecture, distributed systems are a collection of individual components on different machines rather
                        than being a single software product. Possible advantages includes: can utilise small specialist teams, working well with agile development approach, possible in using different languages or framework for different services, higher
                        maintainability and significantly less prone to whole application system down. Some extra reflection was conducted about the Service Oriented Architecture Ontology. More details were recorded in the following. </p>

                    <hr class="major" />
                    <h2>Unit 11 - Future Trends in Secure Software Development</h2>
                    <p>For the group project, I have been finishing up all the functions of the Threat Manager application with no bug. Test cases were being written along the final stage of functionalities implementation. I also started thinking of the
                        reflection of this project. </p>
                    <p>Besides, I started to do some reading about Microservices and Microkernels for the debate activity. It drove my curiosity in knowing that while Microservices have been deemed as a better software development architecture in the main
                        trend, why Microkernels which were mentioned significantly earlier lost to the Monolithic kernel. The research result has come up with the stands of our group in the debate. More details were recorded in the following.</p>

                    <hr class="major" />
                    <h2>Unit 12 - The Great Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate Revisited</h2>
                    <p>The content of the last lecturecast was really appealing to me. It talks a lot about the future trends of OS running in the IOT industry, giving me a larger picture of the industry, which I am currently working in. I will continue
                        to read the lecturecast and related materials. </p>
