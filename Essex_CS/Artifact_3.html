                    <h2>Team Discussion 1 : What is a Secure Programming Language</h2>
                    <h4>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</h4>
                    <p>An important factor, in my perspective, is the scope of application or task we would like to achieve by that language. As Croft R, Xie Y., & Zahedi M. etc (2021) mentioned, security challenges are often oriented towards the task that
                        the language is commonly utilized for. Applications involving interaction with the users or third party, such as those over the internet including web and mobile applications, usually come along with more security concerns. Therefore,
                        is that programming language belongs to its common usage categories could tell if it is secure to a certain extent. For instance, the scientific programming languages such as R, Julia and MATLAB, which have low consideration for
                        security in its design, would definitely be inappropriate for developing a web application, while some languages with lower-level abstraction like C/C++, which usually used for control over the underlying operating system and architecture,
                        are also not appropriate for using as web development considering its genre such as its arbitrary memory manipulation or address which would easily leads to secure vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows error (no way of telling
                        the end of an array or allocated block of memory) and injection errors (manual memory allocation and deallocation and bounds and type checks). C/C++ as a compiled language, the compiler also cannot detect common errors at the run-time.
                        Moreover, JavaScript, TypeScript and PHP are web-oriented languages, while Java, C#, Objective-C and Swift are mobile-oriented languages</p>
                    <p>Another factor is how the programming language handles the most common vulnerabilities faced by the application which requires interaction with the user, customer or other third-parties. For instance, reading input, evaluating expressions,
                        serialization, overflow error and race condition. </p>
                    <p>Community support may also be a factor in considering whether a programming language could be a secure enough application. </p>
                    <p>In addition, the total number of the vulnerabilities reported among the languages should not be considered as a factor. For example, C has the highest number of vulnerabilities reported, with about 50% of all reported in the past 10
                        years(WhiteSource, 2021). One of the reasons is that the C language has a long existence written with more code since its first use. Also, the genre of C language, which is memory manipulation, accounts for a majority of its vulnerabilities
                        reported (Turner, S., 2013). Requirement of manual memory manipulation may easily give rise to many possible vulnerabilities and false usages, but also thanks to this C language can servers as the base language for many higher
                        level languages and operating system, such as being at the hardware / software boundary for mapping their peripherals and I/O pins into memory addresses. </p>

                    <hr class="major" />
                    <h4>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</h4>
                    <p>Python may not be a better language to create operating systems than C. Python is a high-level and interpreted general-purpose language, which has to be run in the given system using another program instead of its local processor,
                        while C language is a straight compiled language which is closed to the hardware. As a compiled language closed to the hardware, C language has multiple characteristics or advantages making it still being built on top of by many
                        operating system and higher level languages including Python (Munoz, D., 2021):
                        <li>portability and efficiency - close to the machine and almost universally available for existing process architectures</li>
                        <li>memory manipulation - arbitrary memory address access and pointer, which is import for system programming and enables computer systems and microcontrollers map their peripherals and I/O pins into memory address</li>
                        <li>deterministic usage of resources - C pointers allow placing data in custom addresses. Languages that depend heavily on memory management or dynamic allocation and garbage collection wound not be a fit for resource-limited systems,
                            such as some embedded systems with limited in time and memory resources</li>
                    </p>
